1. To Make a Switch to a New Career 

Field

According to the Online College

a quarter of online undergraduate

Prospects

The Online College Students 2014

respondents enrolled in an online 

program because they were re-

entering the job market and needed 

more education.<br>

6. To Prepare to Pursue Career

online undergrad students were 

either seeking a new position in 

their field or a promotion.<br>

online program because it was 

required by their profession or 

employer.<br>

About 6 percent of online undergrad 

students said that their primary 

motivation for enrolling in an 

online degree program was that they 

had just finished high school or 

received their GED.
